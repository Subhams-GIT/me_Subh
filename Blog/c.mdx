# C Storage Classes in C

In the C programming language, **storage classes** define the **scope (visibility)**, **lifetime (duration in memory)**, and **linkage (access across files)** of variables and functions.

There are **four** types of storage classes in C:

- `auto`
- `register`
- `static`
- `extern`

Letâ€™s dive into each one in detail.

## ðŸ”¹ `auto` Storage Class

- It is the **default** storage class for variables declared inside a block (function or loop).
- Variables declared with `auto` are stored in **memory (stack)**.
- **Lifetime**: Limited to the block.
- **Scope**: Local to the block.
- **Linkage**: None.

### ðŸ”¸ Example

```c
#include <stdio.h>

void demo() {
    auto int x = 5;  // same as just `int x = 5;`
    printf("%d\n", x);
}


void count() {
    register int i;
    for (i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        printf("%d ", i);
    }
}

void demo() {
    static int counter = 0;
    counter++;
    printf("Counter: %d\n", counter);
}

file1.C
int count = 100;

fil2.C
extern int count;

void show() {
    printf("Count is %d\n", count);
}
